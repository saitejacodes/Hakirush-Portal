/**
 * Query keys. EVERY key starts with ['u', userId] so cached data can never leak across
 * accounts (logout also calls queryClient.clear(), this is defence in depth).
 *
 * Directory data (team, birthdays, anniversaries, new joiners, department colleagues) is ALSO
 * scoped by department: ['u', userId, 'dept', departmentId|'none', ...]. When the server reports a
 * new department, SessionProvider removes the old department's queries (see cacheScope.ts).
 * While `useSession().directoryVerified` is false (offlineUnverified), do not render directory data.
 *
 * Usage in a component:
 *   const keys = useQueryKeys();               // bound to the signed-in user
 *   useQuery({ queryKey: keys.team({ search }), queryFn: ({ signal }) => api.get(..., { signal }) });
 *   queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: keys.leaves() }); // prefix match → all leave lists
 *
 * Add new domains here (one line each) rather than inventing ad-hoc arrays in features.
 * Filters/params objects go LAST so `keys.x()` (no params) works as an invalidation prefix.
